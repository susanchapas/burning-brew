## Brand Archetype, Cialdini Principles, and Competitive Research

Burning Brew embodies the Outlaw archetype — rebellious, raw, and honest. It rejects the over-sweetened “dessert coffee” culture and celebrates the grind itself. The tone is unapologetic, blunt, and rooted in authenticity. This archetype appeals to people who see coffee as fuel, not decoration — those who value grit, focus, and intensity over comfort.

### Cialdini’s Persuasion Principles in Action: ###

Authority: Emphasis on authentic sourcing, honest labeling, and a straightforward presentation builds credibility.

Social Proof: Testimonials and shareable copy like “Join the Grindhouse” connect users through identity.

Scarcity: Limited roasts and exclusive blends create a sense of urgency.

Commitment & Consistency: Returning customers can join a subscription (“The Fossil Order”) that reinforces belonging.

Reciprocity: Visitors receive value first — through guides, brewing tips, or rewards — before being asked to buy.

Unity: Language like “We praise the grind” invites alignment with a shared mindset, not just a product.

### Competitive Landscape: ###

Most competitors (e.g., Black Rifle Coffee, Death Wish Coffee, Onyx Coffee Lab) position themselves as either patriotic, edgy, or artisan. Burning Brew differentiates itself through tone — it’s rebellious without cliché. Instead of nationalism or luxury, it sells truth and intensity — a brutal honesty that resonates with young adults tired of corporate flavor marketing.

## Target Customer Segment ##

Burning Brew targets urban 20–35-year-olds who are independent, ambitious, and skeptical of mainstream branding. They’re creatives, night workers, gym-goers, and entrepreneurs who see coffee as a weapon, not a treat. They’re drawn to authenticity, aesthetic minimalism, and emotional realism — people who value brands that say what they mean.

They’ve outgrown the polished “latte art” scene and want something more grounded: real caffeine, real attitude, no sugarcoating — literally or figuratively.

## Development

Serve the site locally with auto-reload:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Build (minify JS/CSS)

This project uses `esbuild` to minify the site assets into `dist/`.

```bash
npm run build
```

The build command will create `dist/js/scripts.min.js` and `dist/css/styles.min.css`.

## Notes

- `npm start` runs `live-server` for auto-reload during development.
- `npm run build` creates a small `dist/` directory with minified assets.
